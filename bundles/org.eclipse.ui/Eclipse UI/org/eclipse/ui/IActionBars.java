/**
 * Used by a part to access its menu, toolbar, and status line managers.  
 * <p>
 * Within the workbench each part, editor or view, has a private set of action
 * bars.  This set, which contains a menu, toolbar, and status line, appears
 * in the local toolbar for a view and in the window for an editor.  The view
 * may provide an implementation for pre-existing actions or add new actions to
 * the action bars.
 * </p><p>
 * In a workbench window there a number of actions which are applicable to
 * all parts.  Some common examples are <code>CUT</code>, <code>COPY</code> and 
 * <code>PASTE</code>. These actions, known as "global actions", are contributed to 
 * the workbench window by the window itself and shared by all parts.  The
 * presentation is owned by the window.  The implementation is delegated to the
 * active part.  
 * </p><p>
 * To participate in the global action design an <code>IWorkbenchPart</code> should 
 * register a handler for each global action which is implemented by the part.  This 
 * can be done by calling <code>setGlobalActionHandler</code>.  For convenience, the 
 * standard global actions are defined in 
 * <code>org.eclipse.ui.IWorkbenchActionConstants</code>. 
 * </p><p>
 * Additional work is required for the <code>Delete</code> global action.  In
 * this case the accelerator is defined in the menu item text but is not hooked 
 * on the window.  This is to support text editors where the <code>Delete</code> 
 * key is functional even when the <code>Delete</code> action is disabled (no text 
 * is selected).  An implementation for this accelerator must be defined locally, 
 * in each part, by listening for <code>Delete</code> key events.
 * </p><p>
 * A part may also contribute new actions to the action bars as required.  To do
 * this, call <code>getMenuManager</code>, <code>getToolBarManager</code>, or
 * <code>getStatusLineManager</code> as appropriate to get the action target.
 * Add the action(s) to the target and call <code>update</code> to commit
 * any changes to the underlying widgets.
 * </p><p>
 * This interface is not intended to be implemented by clients.
